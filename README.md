# Project Lessons Learned - Trybe, Class 16-B

The proposed challenge was to develop a website containing various information about what I had learned at Trybe up to that point (two weeks into the course). The website should have well-positioned elements and appropriate semantics to make it accessible and better ranked.

## Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS

## Requirements:
[x] Add a specific background color to the page.
[x] Add a top navigation bar with a title.
[x] Add a photo to the page.
[x] Add a list of lessons learned to the page.
[x] Create a section that tells a passage about the learning experience.
[x] Modify attributes related to fonts.
[x] Create a list of lessons you still want to learn for the page.
[x] Apply HTML elements according to their sense and purpose.
[x] Create an article about the learning experience.
[x] Position the article and the section about learnings side by side.
[x] Insert at least one external link on the page.
[x] Test if the page's semantics are approved by the CodeSniffer website.
[x] Add a footer to the page.
[x] Use the Box Model.
[x] Add a table to the page.

## Learnings:

This project allowed me to practice all the knowledge acquired in the first two weeks of Trybe. Using the Box Model and positioning elements side by side through the float property was one of the highlights, as this property can be challenging to use initially. However, the most challenging aspect was building the table, which I hadn't practiced before. Learning how to deal with these HTML elements was a great opportunity.
